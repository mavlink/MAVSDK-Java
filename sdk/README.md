# MAVSDK-Java - SDK

This project is the actual Java SDK that gets deployed on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:mavsdk). It works by connecting to a running instance of `mavsdk_server`, that can be downloaded from the [MAVSDK release artifacts](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/releases). By default, it connects on a `mavsdk_server` instance running locally (i.e. on 'localhost'), but it can connect on any machine over the network.

## Getting started

Because it is deployed on Maven Central, adding MAVSDK-Java to your project is a matter of adding the dependency to your gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.mavsdk:mavsdk:3.6.0'
}
```

In your project, it can then be used to e.g. takeoff with the following (assuming an instance of `mavsdk_server` is running):

```java
import io.mavsdk.action.Action

Action action = new Action();
action.arm().andThen(action.takeoff()).subscribe();
```

Note that the MAVSDK-Java API is using [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), for which extensive documentation can be found online. Don't forget to have a look at our [examples](../examples).

## Contributing

MAVSDK-Java is mainly autogenerated from the MAVSDK [proto files](./proto), using our [protoc-gen-mavsdk plugin](./proto/pb_plugins) and [templates](./templates). It expects to find `protoc-gen-mavsdk` (which can be installed through `pip3 install protoc-gen-mavsdk`) in the PATH.

## Building from sources

### Prerequisites

MAVSDK-Java is built using gradle, but `protoc-gen-mavsdk` must be in your PATH in order to auto-generate the code. It requires Python 3.6+ and can be installed using:

```sh
pip3 install protoc-gen-mavsdk
```

Make sure to add `protoc-gen-mavsdk` to your PATH!

### Building the SDK

Once the prerequisites are met, the SDK can be built with:

```sh
./gradlew build
```
